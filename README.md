# X (Twitter) Clone - Tailwind CSS

This is a learning project where I've developed a clone of the popular social media platform X (formerly Twitter). The project is built using **HTML**, **CSS** (Tailwind CSS), and other essential web technologies.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to practice front-end development skills, particularly with **Tailwind CSS**. While this is a clone of X (Twitter), it focuses on the user interface (UI) and layout without incorporating complex backend functionality like user authentication or databases.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing for efficient and flexible design customization.
- **Header Section**: Mimics the header section from X (Twitter), featuring navigation and branding elements.
- **Tweet Feed**: Displays a scrollable feed of sample tweets with user avatars, timestamps, and tweet content.
- **User Profile**: A simplified user profile section that showcases user information, bio, and their tweets.
- **Like/Retweet/Reply Buttons**: Basic interactive buttons that simulate social media engagement.
